## Product Page

### Products

- Products are displayed on the right side according to wireframe.
- Products are placed in column in individual cards for better UI / UX
- Smooth card angles (radius)
- When hovering on the cards, they increase in size for a better detailed view (bonus)
- They can be added to the right side component (ShopCart).
- I did not use Material UI or Bootstrap and styled everything from scratch myself (to get best accessibility results). I still learnt how to use Material UI though.
- The dataset "products.ts" was renamed to "data.ts" because it was confusing with the other components' names. I changed the entire dataset anyway except the type { picture: string; price: number; name: string }

### Adding products to the ShopCart

- Add to cart button. Same style as all other buttons on the website.
- Hover effect with smooth transitions. Hover target color is also AAA.
- useContext was used for storing items.
- All items are listed in the ShopCart as well as the quantity and the price (for the quantity, a counter was added in the context provider)
- Button that links to CheckoutForm. (an implementation with useHistory / onNavigate was made for fun too and is available in the comments in the code ðŸ˜„)

### Order page

- A checkout form with name, address, etc. and the list of items under.
- Submit logs a message order was successful in the console. there is also a home button to conveniently return to the main page.
- A remove product from cart functionality was made for fun and is available in the comments in the code. ðŸ˜„
- All buttons are the same.

## Extras

- The web app is FULLY RESPONSIVE. ðŸŽ‰
- Detail view of item on hover ðŸŽ‰
